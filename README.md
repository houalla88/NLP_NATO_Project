# NLP_NATO_Project
# This project is an application of NLP (Natural Language Processing)/sensitivity analysis 
# to understand the perception of NATO on Russian Wikipedia. It involves using advanced NLP techniques 
# to analyze how NATO is portrayed in various Wikipedia articles written in Russian. 
# The sensitivity analysis aspect will help in detecting subtle nuances and shifts in sentiment 
# or perspective over time or across different Wikipedia pages. This can provide insights into the general public 
# opinion or narrative trends regarding NATO within the Russian-speaking online community. 
# Additionally, it could highlight areas of misinformation or bias, contributing to a better understanding of international perceptions and digital diplomacy.
